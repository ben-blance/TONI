### Context Awareness

TONI can understand and respond to different contexts, making the interactions more personalized and coherent. Whether it's about ongoing conversations or specific topics, TONI strives to provide relevant and insightful responses.

### Data and Cache Management

TONI utilizes two main directories for data and cache:

- **Data Directory (`/data`):** This directory stores persistent data used by TONI, ensuring that valuable information is retained across sessions.

It's recommended not to tamper with these directories unless necessary for customization or debugging.
